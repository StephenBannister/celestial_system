# celestial_system
A Python program that displays information about planets in our solar system
For each planet the program holds its:
    - Its name.
    - Which star it orbits.
    - Its mass.
    - Its distance from the Sun.
    - Its rotational speed.
    - A sensible list of the planet's moons.
    - A couple of facts about the planet.

All data is held using appropriate data types and is stored in JSON files. Wikipedia was used to help with values for the planets and moons.

A user can query the data through a Tkinter GUI driven menu by asking free text questions such as:

    - Tell me everything about Saturn?
    - How massive is Neptune?
    - Is Pluto in the list of planets?
    - How many moons does Earth have?
